# About

After many years working on both internal and open source web projects like [DotNetNuke](http://www.dotnetnuke.com/), Jon Henning decided to create a new CMS using insights he has gathered over the past 15 years of consulting.  Inspired by the simplicity found in other frameworks like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), Jon attempted to create something similar in a web framework leveraging Microsoft technologies.  In 2011, the project known as Code Endeavors CMS was started.  In 2012, an agreement was reached with his current client, NNR Global Logistics, that allowed the CMS to be enhanced as part of his ongoing consulting work.  It was then that the project was renamed to Videre CMS.
